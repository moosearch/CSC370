          Question 1  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          Suppose we want to compute the equi-join of relations R and S  on

          the attributes R.r and S.s.



          a)   Suppose both relations are represented by sequential  files,

                                                         ----------

               with  no known order on the records.  Outline in pseudo-code

               a procedure which computes the equi-join.

     

               for all tuples tR in R do

               for all tuples tS in S do

                   if tR.r = tS.s

                   then output tR join tS





          b)   Suppose that there are 100 tuples in the  relation  R,  each

               represented by records of 100 bytes.

               Suppose there are 10000  tuples  in  the  relation  S,  each

               represented by records of 800 bytes.

               Suppose each disc block  contains  2000  bytes  and  that  a

               buffer  of  11  blocks is available for holding data read in

               from secondary memory.



               Your procedure in part a) should contain 2  loops.   Compute

               the  number of block accesses (for reading only) required to

                                              --- ------- ----

               compute the join if the outer loop constitutes the  scan  of

               R, and if the buffer is used most effectively.



                   10^2 x 10^2

               R = -----------   = 5 blocks

                   2 x 10^3



                   10^4 x 8 x 10^2

               S = ---------------    = 4000 blocks

                      2 x 10^3 



               So read 5 R blocks into the buffer - leave 6.

               Then just read through S.

               Total 5 + 4000 block accesses.





          c)   Suppose that S is represented by an indexed file, and that s

                                                   -------

               is the indexing attribute.

               Outline in pseudo-code a procedure which computes the  equi-

               join.



               for all tuples in R do

                   use R.r to locate records in S that match S.s

                   output join of matching records





          d)   Why is this second method  likely  to  be  superior  to  the

               first?



               First method requires time proportional to |R| x |S|.

               Second method requires time proportional to |R| x time to

               index into S.  The latter should be no worse than logarithmic

               in |S|.





          Question 2  [50 marks]

                    WHERE S.Major = "CS" and G.Grade = "A" and N.year = 1994





          a)   Draw the "canonical" parse tree for the evaluation  of  this

          Question 3  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          Suppose we want to compute the equi-join of relations R and S  on

          the attributes R.r and S.s.

          Let @b sub R@ and @b sub S@ be the number of disc blocks in R and

          S respectively.

          Let @j sub s@ be the "join selectivity"  of  the  equi-join  just

          specified.

          Let @bfr sub RS@ be the blocking factor for the file representing

          the result of the computation.



          a)   Define "join selectivity" in terms of the size of the Carte-

               sian  product of the inputs versus the size of the result of

               the computation.



               jS = |R join S| / |R X S|



          b)   Suppose that the join  is  computed  by  the  "nested  loop"

               method, using R for the outer loop, and assume that 2 memory

               buffers are used.  Our text gives the following formula  for

               the number of block accesses made.



               Explain, briefly but clearly, the significance  of  each  of

               the  three  items  (i.e., the items separated by + signs) in

               the formula.





               b sub r + (b sub r * b sub s) + ((j sub s * |R| * |S|)/bfr sub RS

               -------    -----------------      ------------------------------

                 1                2                            3



               1: Every record in R must be read in sequence, therefore bR

                  block accesses are required.



               2: Every block of R records require a complete scan of S records.

                  Hence bR * bS block accesses on S.



               3: jS * |R| * |S| = number of records in the output.

                  Divide by blocking factor and we get the number of block

                  accesses to write out the result.







          c)   Suppose the join is computed by the "sort -  merge"  method,

               and  that  a preliminary sort is indeed necessary.  Our text

               gives the following formula for the number of block accesses

               made.



               k*((b sub R * log sub 2 b sub R ) + b sub S * log sub 2 b sub S )) 

                   ---------------------------     ---------------------------

                               1                                2



               + b sub R + b sub S + ((j sub s * |R| * |S|)/bfr sub RS)

                 --------  -------     -------------------------------

                     3        4                       5



               Explain, briefly but clearly, the significance  of  each  of

               the four parts of the formula.



               1 & 2: block accesses to sort the files.

                      k is some constant, about 1.5, depending on sorting algorithm.

                      Of course the equation is useless without an estimate for k.

                

               3: block accesses to scan R   



               4: block accesses to scan S



               5: writing out the result, as under b).







          Question 4  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   Define "the closure F+ of a set of dependencies F"



               F+ = {X --> Y | X --> y can be inferred from F}





          b)   Define "the closure X + of a set of attributes X  with

               respect to a set of dependencies F".



               X+ = {A | X --> A is a member of F+}



          c)   Compute {CE}+ with respect to the set  of  depen-

               dencies:



               AB --> C        D --> EG

               C --> A         BE --> C

               BC --> D        CG --> BD

               ACD --> B       CE --> AG





               {C, E}+ = {C, E, A, G, B, D}



          d)   Suppose we wish to answer (in general) the question: Is  the

               dependency X --> Y in F+.

               Is it necessary to compute F+?  Why/not ?



               It is not necessary because X --> Y is in F+ iff

               Y is a subset of X+.



          d)   Why are we pleased about the answer to c)?



               Because it can be very time consuming to compute F+, whereas

               X+ is relatively quick to compute.





          Question 5  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   Suppose we try to put some relation @R@ with its  associated

               set  of  dependencies  F into some normal form by decomposi-

                                                                 ----------

               tion.  Name the 2 properties of the decomposition which  are

               ----

               essential.



               Dependency preservation, lossless join.



          b)   For each property explain why it is essential.



               If dependencies are not preserved, then the decomposion permits

               values that we already have determined are invalid.



               If not lossless join then "spurious", i.e., invalid tuples

               can be implied by joins on the decomposed tables.



          c)   Suppose the relation R = {A,B,C,D} is  associated  with  the

               dependency set:

                        F = {A --> B, B --> C, C --> D, D --> A}.

               Consider the decomposition: R1 = {A,B}, R2 = {B,C} and R3  =

               {C,D}.

               Compute covers for the  corresponding  projected  dependency

               sets F1, F2, and F3.

               Hint: Right, this is not quite as simple as it looks.

                                        -----



               F1 = {A --> B, B --> A}

               F2 = {B --> C, C --> B}

               F3 = {C --> D, D --> C}



               Note that the second item in each set is not explicit in F.

               But they are certainly in F+, and so must be projected onto

               the decomposed tables.



          d)   Show that the decomposition either is or is  not  dependency

               preserving.



               Note that F1 U F2 U F3 implies D --> A, by transitivity.

               Therefore nothing is lost from F.  Therefore the decomposition is

               dependency preserving.







          Question 6  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   What does it mean for two sets of dependencies F and G to be

               equivalent?

               ----------



               Answer: F and G are equivalent iff ......



               Answer: F and G are equivalent iff F+ = G+

                       or equivalent statement.







          b)   Prove that the following 2 dependency sets either are or are

               not equivalent.



               --Left--        --Right-



               AB --> C        AB --> C

               C --> A         C --> A

               BC --> D        BC --> D

               CD --> B        D --> E

               D --> E         D --> G

               D --> G         BE --> C

               BE --> C        CG --> B

               CG --> D        CE --> G

               CE --> G



               Hint: First try to show that anything in Left is in the clo-

               sure of Right, and then the reverse.



               We note that there are only 3 differences to be accounted for.



               We need to show that CD --> B is in Right+, so we compute

               {CD}+ wrt Right = {C, D, A, E, G, B ..... } and we are

               done as soon as we find B.

               

               We need to show that CG --> D is in Right+, so we compute

               {CG}+ wrt Right = {C, G, A, B, C, D ..... } and we are

               done as soon as we find D.



               We need to show that CG --> B is in Left+, so we compute

               {CG}+ wrt Left = {C, G, A, D, B  ..... } and we are

               done as soon as we find B.







          Question 7  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   Using "dependency" terminology  define  super-key  in  one

               statement:



               The set X is a super-key iff X --> all attributes.



          b)   If X is a super-key, what is the further  requirement  for

               X to be a @key@?



               The set X must also be minimal with respect to the property

               in a).



          c)   Given some X and a set of dependencies F, how would  you

               quickly test to see if X is a super-key?



               Compute X+.  X is a super-key iff X+ = {all attributes}.



          e)   If X is a super-key, how would you go about testing to see

               if it is a key?



               for all A in X compute {X - A}+.

               if {X - A}+ = {all attributes} for some A,

               then X is not minimal and so is not a key.



          d)   The last step in Algorithm 13.4 (Decomposition of R, F  into

               3NF) is:

               "if none of the relation schemas (resulting from the  decom-

               position so far) contains a key of R, then .... "

               How would you go about testing this condition?  Do we need a

               list of all keys?

               



               No, we do not need a list of all keys.

               Let Ri be any of the decomposed relations.

               Then Ri "contains a key of R" iff Ri is a superkey.

               But we can check this as under c) by computing Ri+

               wrt the original set of dependencies.





          Question 8  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   Give the general definition of "second normal form".



               No non-prime attribute is partially dependent on any key.



          b)   Point out why the following relation schema  and  associated

               dependencies is not in second normal form.



               R =     {Stud#, Names, Grade, Course#, Prof}

               F =     {Stud#, Course# --> everything,

                       Stud# --> Names,

                       Course# --> Prof}



               o the only key is {stud#, course#}

   

               o names is non-prime (so is prof).



               o names is partially dependent on the key (so is prof).





          c)   Decompose the schema so that the result is in second  normal

               form.



               R1 = {stud#, names}

               R2 = {stud#, course#, grade}

               R3 = {course#, prof}





          d)   Justify your claim that the result is in second normal form.



               We must project dependencies and recompute the keys.



               F1 = {stud# --> names}, key = stud#

               F2 = {stud#, course# --> grade}, key = {stud#, course#}

               F3 = {course# --> prof} key = course#



               Clearly no partial dependencies remain.  In fact each

               decomposed relation is in BCNF.





          Question 9  [50 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          a)   Consider  the  following  entity  -  relationship   diagram.

               Translate  it  literally  and  without  modification into an

               equivalent diagram using the network model, ( i.e.,  express

                          -------

               it as record types combined into DBTG "set"s).





               

                Sorry, can't do the diagram here.  A copy of this question

                is on display outside my office.



          b)   Outline in a few words the essential functions of  the  net-

               work statements;



               FIND sets up pointers in the currency pointer area





               GET transfers data from the data base to the user work area





               STORE transfers data from the user work area to the data base.



          c)   Using appropriate  FIND  and  GET  statements,  embedded  in

               pseudo-code,  show  how to code the query: "all cities lived

               in at some time by (some) Henry Irving".





               See display outside my office.



          d)   Using appropriate FIND, MODIFY and STORE statements,  embed-

               ded  in pseudo-code, show how to insert the following infor-

               mation into the data base: Henry Irving,  (SIN  =  "123456")

               has just moved from Duncan to Sidney-by-the-Sea.



               Hint: Remember that "MODIFY" lets you change a value  in  an

               existing record, rather than creating a new one.

          Question 10  [50 marks]

          -------- --   -- -----



          a)   One-way, circular linked lists are "typical" representations

               of network "set"s.  Which basic "set" operation(s) are effi-

               ciently computed using this  representation,  (where  "effi-

               ciently" means approximately in constant time")?





               GET first member, GET next member



          b)   Which basic "set" operation(s) are not efficiently  answered

               using  this  representation?   What  would be the worst case

               time complexities of computing these operations?



               GET owner -- time proportional to number of members



               GET previous -- time proportional to number of members



               GET last -- time proportional to number of members



               Insert and delete also.





          c)   What modifications to the representations are often used  to

               improve these results to constant time?



               Pointers from member to owner

               Two way pointers



          d)   What price is paid for these improvements in execution time?



               Extra space (memory) for pointers.



          d)   If the member records of a given instance of a "set" are not

               necessarily  physically adjacent in memory, why might "navi-

               gation" through the data base be "slow".

 

               Since the network model is a "one record at a time" system,

               each GET may require a separate block access.

               So access time per record can be slow.
