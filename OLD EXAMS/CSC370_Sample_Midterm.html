          CSC 370 Mid-Term Exam   -- Total 200 points 





          Question 1  [40 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          Draw a suitable Entity - Relationship diagram for  modelling  the

          following reality:



          o    Lawyers have a name, home address  and  a  legal  speciality

               (e.g. corporate law)



          o    Law firms have a name, address,  phone  number  and  a  head

               partner



          o    All lawyers work for exactly one firm, and  all  firms  have

               some lawyers working for them.



          o    Clients have a name, address and phone number.



          o    A client will have $>=$ 1 lawyer looking  after  them  (they

               may  have  more  than  one  problem),  but a lawyer could be

               without clients.



          o    A client may (but not necessarily) have to appear  in  court

               one  of more times.  If so, each appearance is scheduled for

               a specific date,  and  will  require  the  attendance  of  a

               specific lawyer.



          Make clear in your  diagram  the  distinction  between  entities,

          attributes and relationships.

          Mark:



          o    whether a relationship is 1:1 or many:1 or many:many.



          o    keys



          o    relationship participation as total/partial.



          Assume, for simplicity, that all names are unique.

          Question 2  [40 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----



          Consider the following  relational schema which  is  intended  to

          correspond to the situation described in Question 1.

          Keys are in italics.

                      -------



          LAWYER (name, address, speciality, F name)

                  ----                        -



          FIRM (name, address, phone, head)

                ----



          CLIENT (name, address, phone)

                  ----



          SERVES (L name, C name)

                  ------  ------



          COURT (C name, L name, date)

                  -       -





          a)   Which relations are intended to represent entities?





               Lawyer, Client, Firm









          b)   Which relations are intended to represent relationships?





               Serves, Court









          c)   Why is there no relation for the relationship  ("works for")

                                                                     -

               between Firms and Lawyers?





               Because it is a 1 : many relationship and can absorbed into the 

               relation Lawyer.

               This is more economical than setting up a separate table.









          d)   The key for the COURT relation has not been defined.  If  we

               want  to  leave  open  the possibility that the client could

               appear in court more than once on the  same  day,  but  only

               with a different lawyer, what should the key be?







               We need all 3 attributes to make a (unique of course) key.

          Give SQL expressions, based on the  same  schema,  for  the  same

          queries.  Note that it may be neater to string the expression out

          on one line, no need to spread it over several lines.





          a)   List the names of lawyers who specialise in "company law".



               SELECT name FROM Lawyer WHERE speciality = "company law"

          Question 5  [40 marks]

          -------- -   -- -----





          LAWYER (name, address, speciality, F name)

                  ----                        -

          COURT (C name, L name, date)

                  -       -



          Give tuple-calculus expressions, based on the  same  schema,  for

          the same queries:





          a)   List the names of lawyers who specialise in "company law".



               {t.name | Lawyer(t) and t.speciality = "company law"}







          b)   List the names of clients who have "Jim Boothroyd" as  their

               lawyer.



               {t.C_name | Serves(t) and L_name = "Jim Boot"}





          c)   List the names of clients whose lawyers work for "Shadrock &

               Squisham".



               {t.C_name | Serves(t) and (there exists s)(Lawyer(s) and t.L_name =

                                          s.name and s.Fname = "Shad & Squish"}

               or are lawyers and are due in court on Feb. 28 1995.



               We want a union.  Syntax will require either a renaming of

               attributes or separate computation of the 2 sets.



               S :=  {t.head | Firm(t)};

               T :=  {t.L_name | Court(t) and t.date = "Feb. 28 1995"}

                     {t | S(t) or T(t)}



          e)   List the names of all the clients who do NOT  have  a  court

               date.



               {t.name | Client(t) and (there does not exist s)(Court(s) and t.name

                                                                = s.C_name)}
