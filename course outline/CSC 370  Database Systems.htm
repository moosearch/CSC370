    </td>
    <td class="course_desc_detail" width="80%">
      The objective of the course is to introduce database management 
systems (DBMS) and the theory behind their design and use. There will be
 an emphasis on how to organize, maintain and retrieve--efficiently, and
 effectively--information from a DBMS.  The course will have four main 
areas of focus:<br>
<br>
1. Database design: How can we describe the world in terms of data?<br>
2. Data analysis: How can we pose questions about the world and obtain answers by querying this data?<br>
3. Concurrency and robustness: How may a DBMS implementation permit 
threads to query and modify the same units of data? And what happens 
when there is a system failure in the midst of such access?<br>
4. Efficiency and scalability: How does the DBMS not only store large 
amounts of data but also permit that data to be processed efficiently?
<br>
<br>
The students will be able to design and query databases, implement 
applications on top of databases, as well as understand the internals of
 databases. <br>
